# ThreeJS 3D Scene Editor
 ## Inspired by Unity
 I'm taking inspiration from Unity to make a simple scene editor with ThreeJS. Currently I'm just doing this for fun, but who knows where it will go. 

 ##Tentative Roadmap  
 <s>1. Add mesh selecting</s>  
 2. Add gui to add objects  
 3. Add control to place objects when added from gui  
 4. Add gui to create materials  
 5. Add gui to edit materials  
 6. Add gui to place existing material on objects  
 7. Add post processing  
 8. Add post processing toggles  
 9. Add importing fbx and other models
